I Added a couple of New funtions and Global variables to help in coding
(1) Music.shuffle()
	This shuffles a selected music playlist (dictionary). It is in the Music singleton 

(2)Globals.comicbook[1]
	This is a shortcut for calling the comicbook scenes. use the change_scene_to(load(...INSERT ...)) to call it. 
	check for other callable functions and variables in the globals singleton 
(3)Debug
	It calls debug funtions like Debug.start_debug(), Debug.stop_debug(), and passes its variables to the viewport

(4) Fonts, Music and Videos
	I added a couple of new Dynamic Fonts and Music funtions that can be called from the Music track node. A cinematic scene
	was added to handle all video playing functions. (Note: video player works best with .ogv video format)


(5) Ingame Menu:
	This is a reusable ingame menu i added to give access to all major scenes in the App


(6) Custom input maps:
	Added a couple of custom input maps to enable and disable the comics and game menu scenes 

(7) Enemy kill count

(8) Twitter Login

(9) Blood and smoke Particle effects 

(10) Touch input maps for android (zoom button), updated Scroll function for comic book
